              <p>
                I'm a creative and detail oriented Front End Developer with strong coding and programming skills.
                 I love to work with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, frameworks, DOM Manipulation and other programming tools. 
                 Highly adept at both independent and collaborative projects
                 with an emphasis on landing page and website development. My interests revolves around
                web languages, creating design elements and ensuring that a website or application is intuitive. 
                Besides, I also like to strike a balance between functional and aesthetic design to enhance the user's experience.
